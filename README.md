# NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib Tutorial Repository

A comprehensive collection of tutorials and examples for three essential Python libraries used in data science, scientific computing, and data visualization.

## Overview

This repository contains organized tutorials and practical examples for:

- **NumPy**: Fundamental package for numerical computing in Python
- **Pandas**: Powerful data manipulation and analysis library
- **Matplotlib**: Comprehensive plotting and visualization library

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before working with these tutorials, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

For Jupyter Notebook support:

```bash
pip install jupyter notebook
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/balu548411/numpy-pandas-matplotlib.git
cd numpy-pandas-matplotlib
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter
```

## Learning Path

### 1. NumPy (Start Here)
Begin with NumPy to understand the fundamentals of numerical computing in Python. Learn about arrays, operations, and mathematical functions.

**Location**: `2-numpy/`

### 2. Pandas
After mastering NumPy, move to Pandas for data manipulation and analysis. Learn to work with DataFrames, handle missing data, perform merges, and work with time series.

**Location**: `3-pandas/`

### 3. Matplotlib
Finally, learn Matplotlib to visualize your data. Create various chart types, customize plots, and save visualizations.

**Location**: `4-matplotlib/`

## Usage

Each directory contains Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) that you can open and run:

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Navigate to the desired directory and open the notebook file

3. Run cells sequentially to follow along with the tutorials
